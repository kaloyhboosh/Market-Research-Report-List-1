<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tidal Current Generator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Power Generation</li><li>Vertical Power Generation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The tidal current generator market is primarily divided into horizontal and vertical power generation types. Horizontal power generation utilizes turbines aligned parallel to the tidal flow, optimizing energy capture from currents. In contrast, vertical power generation features turbines positioned upright, harnessing tidal energy more efficiently in varying water depths. Both designs aim to maximize energy output while minimizing environmental impacts, contributing to renewable energy diversification and supporting efforts to combat climate change through sustainable harnessing of marine resources.</p></p>
