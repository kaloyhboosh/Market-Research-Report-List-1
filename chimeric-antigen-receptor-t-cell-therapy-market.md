<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Chimeric Antigen Receptor T Cell Therapy Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Allogeneic</li><li>Autologous</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T cell therapy primarily involves two market types: autologous and allogeneic. Autologous CAR T therapy uses a patientâ€™s own T cells, which are genetically modified to target cancer cells, offering personalized treatment but requiring time for cell collection and modification. In contrast, allogeneic CAR T therapy utilizes T cells from a healthy donor, allowing for off-the-shelf availability and immediate treatment options but presents challenges like immune rejection and graft-versus-host disease.</p></p>
