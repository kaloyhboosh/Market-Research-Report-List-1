<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Metal Thermal Spray Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Combustion Flame Process</li><li>Electrical Process</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The metal thermal spray coating market is primarily divided into two types: the combustion flame process and the electrical process. The combustion flame process involves using a fuel gas and oxygen to create a high-temperature flame that melts metal powders, which are then sprayed onto a surface to form a coating. In contrast, the electrical process utilizes electric arcs or plasma to heat and propel molten metal particles onto substrates, resulting in strong, durable coatings. Both methods enhance surface properties and extend the lifespan of components.</p></p>
