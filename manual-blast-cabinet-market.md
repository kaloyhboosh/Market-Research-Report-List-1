<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Manual Blast Cabinet Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pressure Blast Cabinet</li><li>Suction Blast Cabinet</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Manual Blast Cabinet market features two primary types: pressure blast cabinets and suction blast cabinets. Pressure blast cabinets use compressed air to propel abrasive materials at high velocities, resulting in efficient and uniform surface finishing. In contrast, suction blast cabinets utilize a siphon mechanism, drawing abrasives from a hopper to create a less intense blast, making them suitable for delicate materials or intricate designs. Both types cater to various industries, including manufacturing, automotive, and aerospace, by enhancing surface preparation processes.</p></p>
